# **Urban Info**

## Purpose Of The Project
This project was created to be interesting and intereative. Giving a full diplay of our current coding skills and abilities. The idea of this project was to educate the user with details pertaining to major urban areas. It displays a variety of area qualites that the user can click to dispay futher detailed information of that specific area and the statistics associated with them. 

## Functionality

The top right of this website displays a "Meet the Team" button that will display each collaburators information for Github and LinkedIn.  

This website works by typing in a name of a major urban area into the search bar. The seacrch bar offers auto-complete of urban area names depending on the letters inputed. 

There is a history section under the search bar that will save your searches. It will save them even if you exit the page and come back. 

You can simply click any of the recent searches done to view urban area data without time loss. This feature does not save duplicate searches. 

If you would like to clear your history, all you have to do is press the "Clear History" button. This will erase all the urban area history that was gathered.

After inputing or selecting a name of an urban area, you will then be able to click on the area quality categories that you would like further information on. 

A drop down effect will then display more detailed information and statistics of the qualites associated with the area that is chosen.

To find the definition information for the qualities within the area categories press the "Date Legend" button. This will explain the statistics.
